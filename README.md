# ToDo Bro

This is a simple ToDo List app built using **ReactJS**. It uses **React Hooks** to manage and store the state, allowing tasks to be added, edited, deleted, and marked as completedâ€”all without reloading the page. The app also saves your tasks in the browser's **localStorage** so your list persists even after refreshing.

**Styling:**

It is also **very responsive** and works well on all device sizes.
